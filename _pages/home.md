    excerpt: Tonio Buonassisi is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is pioneering the application of artificial intelligence to develop new materials for societally beneficial applications. His research in solar photovoltaics and technoeconomic analysis assisted technology developments in dozens of companies, earning him a US Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, and a Google Faculty Award. He directs the ADDEPT Center, a DOE-funded national center devoted to making semi-transparent perovskite solar cells *durable* for terrestrial tandems. He is PI of the Accelerated Materials Lab for Sustainability (AMLS) at MIT, and served as founding director for the Accelerated Materials Development for Manufacturing Programme in Singapore. A recipient of the MIT Everett Moore Baker Memorial Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, his passion for education is evidenced by the ~1M views of his OpenCourseware/YouTube PV lectures series.

Robotics and AI are regarded as transformative tools for scientific discovery and integral components of future laboratories. The primary goal of the summer school is to engage students in laboratory automation for the discovery of energy materials. Through lectures, coding tutorials, and robotic synthesis experiments, participants will explore closed-loop experiment design, machine learning, data handling and visualization, as well as hands-on lab work to create thin-film semiconductors using a robotic platform.

We aim to foster the development of the future workforce in materials science, engineering, computer science, physics, and related fields, anticipating that science and research will increasingly integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML).

The summer school is a 3 day event and open to all students, postdocs, and professionals from interdisciplinary backgrounds. No prior coding experience is required.

## Scope:
- Robot-Assisted Synthesis of Functional Materials: Participants will actively engage in hands-on lab experiments to fabricate and characterize thin-film materials using the Foundry’s AutoBot robotic platform.
- High-Throughput and Automated Characterization: Participants will engage in high-throughput characterization and data management.
- AI/ML Application Exploration: Participants will learn how AI/ML is currently being utilized in materials science by actively applying it to data collected in the lab. Participants will explore techniques that could revolutionize research practices.
- Hardware Development: We will teach you about hardware development considerations for autonomous laboratories.
- Gap Identification: We will identify gaps in knowledge and training that hinder the use of AI/ML in materials science. Participants will explore AI/ML tools to complement research practices.
